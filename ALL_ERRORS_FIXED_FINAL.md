# ✅ ALL ERRORS FIXED - FINAL STATUS

## 🎉 Frontend: **0 TypeScript Errors!**

All frontend TypeScript errors have been successfully resolved!

---

## 🎉 Backend: **0 TypeScript Errors!**

All backend TypeScript errors have been successfully resolved!

### Final Fix Applied:
- ✅ **TS6059 Error Fixed**: Updated `backend/tsconfig.json` to set `rootDir` to `"../"` (project root) and included shared types in the `include` array
  - This allows TypeScript to properly recognize the monorepo structure where shared types are located outside the backend directory
  - Matches the configuration pattern already used in `tsconfig.build.json`
